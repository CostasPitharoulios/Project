# Polygonal Curves Clustering & LSH Hashing

**Project 1: LSH**  
Implementation of LSH (Locality-sensitive hashing) algorithm for the hashing of points and polygonal curves(sequences of points).  
src/ANN/  

**Project 2: Clustering**  
K-means/K-medoids for points and polygonal curves.  
Employed various approaches:  

Initialization:  
- Random selection of K points/K curves  
- K-means++  

Assignment:  
- Lloyd's assignment  
- Assigment by Range search with LSH for points/curves (inverse assignment)  

Update:  
- Partitioning Aroung Medoids (PAM) a la Lloyds  
- Mean Vector / DTW centroid curve  

**Project 3: Wind Prediction**
